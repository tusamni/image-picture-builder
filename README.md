# Sharp Image Resize and Reformat

A quick and dirty tool to take a folder full of images (./input), resize them and reformat them using Sharp.

To run the tool, place your images in the `input` folder, then simply run:

```npm run optimize```

When you're done with the images and want to clean the folders out:

```npm run clean```

Or just delete the input and output folders, the script will check and create them next time if need be.
