# sharp
A quick and dirty tool to take a folder full of images, resize them and reformat them using Sharp.

To run the tool, place your images in the `input` folder and make sure there's an `output` folder as well in the root directory.

Then simply run:

```npm run optimize```

When you're done with the images and want to clean the folders out:

```npm run clean```
